# hw3- Implementation & Testing

The goal of this assignment is to redesign and implement features for the Expense Tracker App, to improve adherence to non-functional requirements (e.g., understandability, modularity, extensibility, testability), design principles/patterns (e.g., open-closed principle, Strategy design pattern), and best practices.

# Features added

Added feature to undo selected transaction
Added 6 new testcases to check for the below cases

1. Add Transaction:

- Steps: Add a transaction with amount 50.00 and category ”food”
- Expected Output: Transaction is added to the table, Total Cost is updated

2. Invalid Input Handling:

- Steps: Attempt to add a transaction with an invalid amount or category
- Expected Output: Error messages are displayed, transactions and Total Cost remain unchanged

3. Filter by Amount:

- Steps: Add multiple transactions with different amounts, apply amount filter
- Expected Output: Only transactions matching the amount are returned (and will be highlighted)

4. Filter by Category:

- Steps: Add multiple transactions with different categories, apply category filter
- Expected Output: Only transactions matching the category are returned (and will be highlighted)

5. Undo Disallowed:

- Steps: Attempt to undo when the transactions list is empty
- Expected Output: Either UI widget is disabled or an error code (exception) is returned (thrown).
